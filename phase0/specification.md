Our project is called Real Estate Finder & the main idea is that we will connect buyer(s) to a seller of some real estate / property with the goal of purchasing that real estate / property.

For properties:

	- A buyer should be able to view and like properties.
	- A seller should be able to list and delist properties.

For "purchasing":
	
	- Buyer(s) should be able to send an offer to seller for a given real estate.
	- A seller should be able to view their current offers and accept or reject a given offer.

We also want to enable a buyer to join / leave a group of buyers.
