### Phase Zero
1. Clone the repository and open with intelliJ
2. IntelliJ may not correctly open the project on the first run, but we found the following fix makes the most sense:
   1. After opening, specify the SDK (version 11 +, language level = SDK Default ) and make sure the java folders are marked as sources root and test root respectively.  
   2. Quit intelliJ (cmd + q or alt - f4) and open it again.
   3. Open the [UserTest](src/test/java/UserTest.java) file, hover on the import statement for JUnit and add it to the class path. 
   4. Hover on the User reference, and select add dependency main.
3. Compile and run the `RunCLI` class to see the use case for phase zero.
